# Olist-Customer-Analytics-and-Churn-Prediction
SQL + Python project analyzing 100K+ Olist e-commerce transactions to predict customer churn. Includes SQL modeling, RFM segmentation, and machine learning insights for retention strategy.

# Customer Analytics and Churn Prediction using SQL and Python (Olist E-commerce)

This project uses SQL and Python to analyze Olist’s e-commerce data and predict customer churn. It shows how raw transactional data can be changed into useful insights that improve customer satisfaction, retention, and profits.

#Project Overview
The project combines five Olist datasets, including customers, orders, payments, and reviews, to create a unified customer profile. Using RFM segmentation and machine learning methods like Random Forest and Logistic Regression, it identifies high-value and at-risk customers for retention strategies.

#Tools & Techniques
- SQL (PostgreSQL) – Data aggregation and modeling  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) – Feature engineering and churn modeling  
- Jupyter Notebook – Exploratory and predictive analysis

## Key Insights
- About 34% of customers are at risk of churning  
- Delivery delays and low review scores are strong indicators of churn  
- The top 20% of customers generate over 60% of total revenue  
- The Random Forest model achieved ROC-AUC = 0.91
